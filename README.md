# Mental_Disorders_Viz
d3.js visualisations about comorbidity in mental disorders

This is a project that developed out of a coursework for Cardiff University.

To view it please start a local server (e.g. with Python in the path you downloaded the files: python -m http.server)
and then go to your localhost in your browser which will automatically open the index.html file.

For futher information on the files and an analysis of the visualisations please see the Visualisation_Analysis.pdf file.

Happy Coding! ;)
